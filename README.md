# CabConnect Partners App

CabConnect Partners App is an Android application designed for drivers to register themselves and their cars on the platform, offering efficient and reliable cab services to potential customers. This project emerged from my curiosity and obsession to understand the inner workings of renowned cab-hailing apps like Uber. Handling the complete development cycle from design to development including both the frontend and the backend.


## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Drivers can seamlessly register and log in to the app using phone verification through Firebase, ensuring a quick and secure onboarding process.
-  Google Maps Preview: Upon successful registration, drivers land on the main home screen featuring Google Maps. The map interface serves as a central hub for trip information and navigation.
- Discoverability Toggle: Drivers have the option to go discoverable or undiscoverable by using a toggle. This allows them to manage their availability for trip requests.
- Real-time Trip Requests: Drivers receive trip requests in real-time, allowing them to promptly respond to customer demands and maximize efficiency.
- Trip Request Notification: When a trip request is received, drivers are notified through a bottom sheet, presenting essential trip details. From this sheet, drivers can either accept or reject the trip.
- Trip Details: Upon accepting a trip, drivers gain access to complete trip details, including customer information, pickup location, and drop-off destination.
- Google Maps Navigation: To ensure seamless navigation, drivers can utilize Google Maps directions to reach the pickup or drop-off point efficiently.
- Trip Completion: After a successful trip, drivers have the option to end the trip, finalizing the journey and enabling them to be available for the next customer request.
